# 👋 Hi, I'm GabryCoso

## Who I am

Software developer with a focus on **systems engineering, AI and full-stack product development**.
I work across the stack, from low-level and OS-related software to web, desktop and mobile applications.

I take a pragmatic, execution-driven approach, with strong attention to **architecture, performance and long-term maintainability**.

## What I'm currently working on

* Custom operating system concepts and systems-level software
* Browsers and platform-level tooling
* AI integrations embedded into products
* Web platforms and desktop/mobile applications

Most projects are iterative and experimental, with a strong focus on learning by building.

## Tools & technologies

* Systems programming (C/C++, low-level concepts)
* Web development (frontend & backend)
* Desktop & mobile app development
* Linux-based environments
* AI tooling and automation

Tooling varies by project; I prioritize the right tool over fixed stacks.
